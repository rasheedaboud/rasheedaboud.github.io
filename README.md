# My Blog Site

Thought I would try a new new library to make this site. I've never played around with [Vike](https://vike.dev/) before. So far its has been very pleasant to work with.

Very few steps required to generate a mostly static generated site. I opted to keep the blog post pages dynamically generated for now. The only snag I ran into was dynamically changing the title and description of each page. I just fell back to a use effect, probably not the best for SEO. But lets call a spade a spade, I very much doubt that will be the limiting factor for traffic to my site.

I still think I prefer Giraffe to build server rendered content, but this might be an interesting library to use from Fable? Something to noddle around.
