      </h1>
      <p className='text-gray-700 my-5'>
        I&#39;m Rasheed, a passionate self-taught Software Developer based in
        St. Albert, AB. With a chemical technology background,{" "}
        <strong>asset integrity</strong> and over seven years of experience in{" "}
        <strong>software development</strong>, I have a unique perspective that
        blends industry knowledge with technical expertise. I thrive on solving
        complex problems, promoting new technologies, and developing software
        applications that make an impact.
      </p>
      <h2 className='text-xl font-black text-pretty uppercase'>Background</h2>
      <p className='text-gray-700 my-5'>
        Throughout my career, I've gained extensive experience in the field of{" "}
        <strong>asset integrity</strong>, quality assurance, and inspection of
        stationary pressure equipment. From an Inservice Inspector to a{" "}
        <strong>Chief Inspector</strong>, I have been deeply involved in
        coordinating non-destructive examination (NDE) and repair activities,
        assessing the condition and estimating the remaining life of pressure
        vessels and piping systems, and overseeing construction and maintenance
        projects across various companies in Alberta.
      </p>
      <p className='text-gray-700 my-5'>
        My responsibilities have also included determining inspection intervals,
        reviewing and approving Inspection & Test Plans (ITPs), conducting
        contractor audits for compliance with regulatory standards, and
        interfacing with the Alberta Boilers Safety Association (ABSA) for the
        repair and alteration of pressure equipment. With experience ranging
        from field-level <strong>QA/QC</strong> to high-level asset integrity
        management and strategic planning, I've developed strong skills in
        ensuring both the compliance and performance of pressure systems within
        the energy sector. As a hands-on professional, I've also worked closely
        with fabrication processes and have experience in welding using various
        processes, supporting my comprehensive understanding of the technical
        aspects of my field.
      </p>
      <p className='text-gray-700 my-5'>
        My passion for web development blossomed after mastering the
        fundamentals of <strong>C#, HTML, CSS,</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which created a strong foundation for my
        evolving love affair with coding. Embarking on my journey as a
        self-taught developer, I eagerly dove into ASP.NET Core 1.0 to build
        robust and scalable web applications. From there, my curiosity led me to
        explore the intricacies of <strong>F#</strong>, attracted by its
        succinct syntax and functional programming elegance, which brought a
        whole new dimension to my understanding of software development.
      </p>
      <p className='text-gray-700 my-5'>
        Complementing my backend expertise, I embraced the dynamism of{" "}
        <strong>React</strong> to construct responsive and interactive UIs while
        simultaneously delving deep into <strong>SQL Server</strong> to harness
        the power of relational databases. Azure technologies further expanded
        my skill set as I integrated cloud solutions such as{" "}
        <strong>
          Azure Functions, Blob Storage, Queues, and Table Storage
        </strong>{" "}
        into my projects, appreciating the scalability and flexibility of
        cloud-native applications.
      </p>
      <p className='text-gray-700 my-5'>
        Over the last two years, F# <strong>Feliz</strong> using{" "}
        <strong>Fable</strong> has become the focus of my work, reveling in the
        delight of full-stack F# development that enables me to write concise
        and maintainable code while leveraging the best of both .NET and modern
        JavaScript ecosystems. This journey of continuous learning and
        application has not only fulfilled my technical aspirations but has also
        been a truly exhilarating adventure in the world of web development.
