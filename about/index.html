With a chemical technology background,<!-- --> <strong>asset integrity</strong> and over seven years of experience in<!-- --> <strong>software development</strong>, I have a unique perspective that blends industry knowledge with technical expertise. I thrive on solving complex problems, promoting new technologies, and developing software applications that make an impact.</p><h2 class="text-xl font-black text-pretty uppercase">Background</h2><p class="text-gray-700 my-5">Throughout my career, I&#x27;ve gained extensive experience in the field of<!-- --> <strong>asset integrity</strong>, quality assurance, and inspection of stationary pressure equipment. From an Inservice Inspector to a<!-- --> <strong>Chief Inspector</strong>, I have been deeply involved in coordinating non-destructive examination (NDE) and repair activities, assessing the condition and estimating the remaining life of pressure vessels and piping systems, and overseeing construction and maintenance projects across various companies in Alberta.</p><p class="text-gray-700 my-5">My responsibilities have also included determining inspection intervals, reviewing and approving Inspection &amp; Test Plans (ITPs), conducting contractor audits for compliance with regulatory standards, and interfacing with the Alberta Boilers Safety Association (ABSA) for the repair and alteration of pressure equipment. With experience ranging from field-level <strong>QA/QC</strong> to high-level asset integrity management and strategic planning, I&#x27;ve developed strong skills in ensuring both the compliance and performance of pressure systems within the energy sector. As a hands-on professional, I&#x27;ve also worked closely with fabrication processes and have experience in welding using various processes, supporting my comprehensive understanding of the technical aspects of my field.</p><p class="text-gray-700 my-5">My passion for web development blossomed after mastering the fundamentals of <strong>C#, HTML, CSS,</strong> and<!-- --> <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which created a strong foundation for my evolving love affair with coding. Embarking on my journey as a self-taught developer, I eagerly dove into ASP.NET Core 1.0 to build robust and scalable web applications. From there, my curiosity led me to explore the intricacies of <strong>F#</strong>, attracted by its succinct syntax and functional programming elegance, which brought a whole new dimension to my understanding of software development.</p><p class="text-gray-700 my-5">Complementing my backend expertise, I embraced the dynamism of<!-- --> <strong>React</strong> to construct responsive and interactive UIs while simultaneously delving deep into <strong>SQL Server</strong> to harness the power of relational databases. Azure technologies further expanded my skill set as I integrated cloud solutions such as<!-- --> <strong>Azure Functions, Blob Storage, Queues, and Table Storage</strong> <!-- -->into my projects, appreciating the scalability and flexibility of cloud-native applications.</p><p class="text-gray-700 my-5">Over the last two years, F# <strong>Feliz</strong> using<!-- --> <strong>Fable</strong> has become the focus of my work, reveling in the delight of full-stack F# development that enables me to write concise and maintainable code while leveraging the best of both .NET and modern JavaScript ecosystems. This journey of continuous learning and application has not only fulfilled my technical aspirations but has also been a truly exhilarating adventure in the world of web development.</p><h2 class="text-xl font-black text-pretty uppercase">Skills &amp; Expertise</h2><ul class="list-disc mx-10 my-5"><li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> I am proficient in C#, F#, Typescript, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.</li><li><strong>Frameworks &amp; Libraries:</strong> My toolkit includes React, EF Core, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, Razor Pages, and ASP.NET Core MVC.</li><li><strong>UI/UX Design:</strong> I have experience with Syncfusion controls, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS.</li><li><strong>Microsoft Azure:</strong> I&#x27;ve utilized a wide range of Azure services, such as Azure Functions, Azure App Service, and Azure Active Directory.</li><li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> I have exceptional skills in dissecting and solving complex issues.</li><li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Precision in coding and system design is something I highly value.</li><li><strong>Self-Motivated Learner:</strong> The tech field is ever-evolving, and so is my knowledge base.</li></ul><h2 class="text-xl font-black text-pretty uppercase">Projects</h2><p class="text-gray-700 my-5">Here&#x27;s a snapshot of some applications I&#x27;ve developed:</p><ul class="list-disc mx-10 my-5"><li><strong>NDT Tracking Software:</strong> Tracks Non-Destructive Testing data for equipment and materials.</li><li><strong>Welding QA/QC Software:</strong> Ensures the quality and safety of welding operations.</li><li><strong>Inspection Tracking Software:</strong> Provides real-time tracking of equipment and facility inspections.</li><li><strong>Visions Task Generator:</strong> Assists in generating tasks for system based on client specifications.</li><li><strong>AI Generated API Reports:</strong> Leverages AI for real-time data analysis in API reporting.</li><li><strong>Fancy Todo App:</strong> A serverless application showcasing my skills in creating a progress tracking tool.</li></ul><h2 class="text-xl font-black text-pretty uppercase">Continuous Learning</h2><p class="text-gray-700 my-5">I may have started as a self-taught developer, but my education never stops.
